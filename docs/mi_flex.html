<p><font size = "6"> About this dashboard… </font><br />
<font size = "3"> This idea was initially designed by <a
href="mailto:rswaty@tnc.org">Randy Swaty</a> as an alternative to a
PowerPoint presentation. There was interest in building on this idea in
the conservation community and I, <a
href="mailto:mwalimaa@gmail.com">Myles Walimaa</a>, made some updates
with newer data and a new charts. This can certainly be built upon and
these workflows may be used for any area of interest. The State of
Michigan is the target area for this dashboard, since it is where both
Randy and I have lived for years.</p>
<p>Randy is an ecologist for The Nature Conservancy and I am a former
National Park Service employee and currently a GIS Analyst. We both work
with the <a href="https://conservationdatalab.org/">Conservation Data
Lab</a> to mentor students in the art of computer coding and data
visualization, particularly for conservation purposes.</p>
<p>The purpose of this dashboard is to explore the major ecosystems of
Michigan’s past and how they have changed.<br />
As you explore, ask yourself some of these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an “ecosystem” to you? How coarse or fine should we define
these?<br />
</li>
<li>What percentage of Michigan was/is covered by wetlands? How
important are wetlands to you? What is their ecological value?<br />
</li>
<li>How often do you think wildfires occurred historically? Can you
think of any ecosystems that are fire dependent?<br />
</li>
<li>Which ecosystems in Michigan have you seen? Are there any you would
like to see?<br />
</li>
<li>Are there any trends that you have noticed, based off the data
presented?</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size = "3"> <strong>PLEASE read the disclaimers on each slide
explaining the assumptions with each dataset. This is meant for
exploratory purposes only.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>Michigan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Michigan is located in America’s “midwest” region, one of the
more northern states.</p></li>
<li><p>It shares borders with Ohio, Indiana, Illinois (nautical), and
Wisconsin, as well as international borders with Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>It contains two peninsulas (upper and lower) separated by the
Mackinac Bridge. Residents north of the bridge are called “Yoopers”, and
residents south/below the bridge are called “Trolls”.</p></li>
<li><p>It is also called the “Great Lakes State”, as it borders 4/5 of
the Laurentian Great Lakes.</p></li>
<li><p>It is home to Detroit, the Motor City, as well as the birthplace
of <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ff2Z0Dq2sg">Motown</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are 62 million acres of land within its political
borders.</p></li>
<li><p>Isle Royale National Park is Michigan’s only National Park
(proper) and is the least visited park in the NPS system, as it takes a
5 hour ferry ride to get to the incredibly remote island.</p></li>

Historical map of Michigan based on LANDFIRE’s BioPhysical Settings
</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
This map was created using LANDFIRE’s BioPhysical Settings. As there was
no satellite imagery 300 years ago, this is a <em>model</em> of what the
historical ecosystems looked like based soil types, climate, elevation,
ecological succession, among many other datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This was intentionally non-interactive simply to give you a broad
visual of what things probably looked like.</p></li>
<li><p>This is coarse ecosystem representation since it is difficult to
display several dozen ecosystem types on a single map.</p></li>
<li><p>The original data displayed plots of 30m x 30m squares that we
call “pixels”, and Michigan has over 500 million of them!</p></li>
<li><p>This map has much lower pixel resolution than mentioned above,
again to simply give you an idea of what things may have looked like
without going into great detail.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what we think the distribution of ecosystems looked like
prior to European settlement. The caretakers of this land at the time
were the indigenous natives who called the Great Lakes their home. They
recognized the value of fire for regeneration and resiliency, often
performing “prescribed” burns to keep their home strong and healthy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you think of non-anthroprogenic disturbances to these
ecosystems?</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore this map created by <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native
Land Digital</a> to learn more about which tribes were located where.
Botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer’s book <a
href="https://milkweed.org/book/braiding-sweetgrass">Braiding
Sweetgrass</a> provides valuable insight on the traditional ways the
natives connected with the land, largely through combining ancient
philosophy and modern science.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
This chart was created using LANDFIRE’s BioPhysical Settings. As there
was no satellite imagery 300 years ago, this is a <em>model</em> of what
the historical ecosystems looked like based soil types, climate,
elevation, ecological succession, among many other datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BioPhysical Settings (BPS) have a “fine” scale classification
called “BPS_NAME” and a “coarse” scale classification called
“GROUPVEG”.</p></li>
<li><p>The acreages were calculated based on the quantity of
900m<sup>2</sup> pixels (30m x 30m), which was converted to
acres.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hover, you can see how many acres of each ecosystem used
to exist (roughly).</p></li>
<li><p>Use your mouse to zoom in on smaller areas by drawing a
box.</p></li>
<li><p>You can reset the zoom by clicking the “house” icon at the top
left of the chart.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How accurate do you think this chart is?</p>
<p>Do you think BPS_NAME or GROUPVEG has higher accuracy in describing
ecosystems?</p>
<p>Take “North-Central Interior Beech-Maple Forest” for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>GROUPVEG says this is mostly hardwoods, would you agree?<br />
</li>
<li>Do you think these pixels contain <em>only</em> Beech and Maple
trees?<br />
</li>
<li>What is the ratio of Beech-to-Maple in these forests? Do you think
it varies?</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is that this is <em>not</em> a perfect representation,
although it helps us gain a general understanding of what probably was
going on several hundred years ago. If you want to explore the BPS
dataset further, you can find <a
href="https://www.landfire.gov/bps.php">information here</a> and
<strong>Randy knows where there is a .pdf or something that has
descriptions of what all the silly BPS_NAMEs mean, with examples of what
kind of things will probably be found there… right??? LIKE THE EVT
ONE??? IT MUST EXIST SOMEWHERE</strong></p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
This chart was created using LANDFIRE’s Existing Vegetation Type. This
uses satellite imagery, ground assessment, and other methods to describe
current “ecosystems” (or lack thereof). I grouped all the developed
sub-categories into a single “Developed” classification.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) has a “fine” scale classification
called “EVT_NAME” and a “coarse” scale classification called
“EVT_PHYS”.</p></li>
<li><p>The acreages were calculated based on the quantity of
900m<sup>2</sup> pixels (30m x 30m), which was converted to
acres.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hover, you can see how many acres of each ecosystem
exists (roughly).</p></li>
<li><p>Use your mouse to zoom in on smaller areas by drawing a
box.</p></li>
<li><p>You can reset the zoom by clicking the “house” icon at the top
left of the chart.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Does anything jump out to you as surprising?</p>
<p>Should “ruderal” ecosystems be classified as agriculture, exotic, or
something else? Disturbed?</p>
<p>What do you notice about the historical and current ratios of
conifers-to-hardwoods?</p>
<p>Again, this is <em>not</em> a perfect representation of today’s
conditions and is meant for scales of several thousand+ acres. If you
want to explore the EVT dataset further, you can find <a
href="https://www.landfire.gov/evt.php">information here</a> and can
read about its development. There is a nifty <a
href="https://www.landfire.gov/documents/LANDFIRE_Ecological_Systems_Descriptions_CONUS.pdf">handbook</a>
that discusses each ecosystem classification in a fair amount of depth,
so you may get a better idea of what you may find there.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The assumptions made in this chart are
that <em>if</em> the ecosystems are no longer following the trajectory
of natural ecological succession, <em>then</em> they have been converted
into something unnatural. This chart does not consider ecosystems
changing from one to another as that may happen naturally, only change
into non-native, mineland, agriculture, development, or the like.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can see which of the ecosystems remained relatively
untouched, as well as the ones that were heavily affected.</p></li>
<li><p>The acreages were calculated based on the quantity of
900m<sup>2</sup> pixels (30m x 30m), which was converted to
acres.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hover, you can see how many acres of each ecosystem
changed (roughly).</p></li>
<li><p>Use your mouse to zoom in on smaller areas by drawing a
box.</p></li>
<li><p>You can reset the zoom by clicking the “house” icon at the top
left of the chart.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which ecosystems remain mostly the same? Is this surprising?</p>
<p>Where did most of the agricultural land come from? Do you notice any
trends?</p>
<p>Are there any ecosystems that might be close to disappearing
completely?</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
Unfortunately, this is <em>not</em> an “apples to apples” comparison.
The datasets used were BioPhysical Settings (historical model) and
Existing Vegetation Type (current satellite imagery, ground assessment,
other methods). Additionally, the Existing Vegetation Type is not a
perfect representation of the ground because there can be multiple
ecosystems found in 900 m<sup>2</sup> (remember 30m x 30m pixels).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This chart provides a general idea of how Michigan land has
changed on a coarse scale.</p></li>
<li><p>BPS and EVT were stacked on top of each other, and we extracted
the coarse categories from those datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>The left side shows coarse landcover from the past (BPS), and the
right shows current landcover (EVT).</p></li>
<li><p>The grey bands represent transitions from one to
another.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hover, the number value is in acres (approx).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Does anything surprise you about how things have changed?</p>
<p>Which ecosystems had the least amount of conversion? What about the
most?</p>
<p>Why did so little Agricultural land come from Coniferous
ecosystems?</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br />
Unfortunately, this is <em>not</em> an “apples to apples” comparison.
The datasets used were BioPhysical Settings (historical model) and
Existing Vegetation Type (current satellite imagery, ground assessment,
other methods). Additionally, the Existing Vegetation Type is not a
perfect representation of the ground because there can be multiple
ecosystems found in 900 m<sup>2</sup> (remember 30m x 30m pixels).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For those of you who want to explore this conversion further,
search no more!</p></li>
<li><p>BPS and EVT were overlaid on top of each other the attributes of
each pixel were extracted.</p></li>
<li><p>The left side shows the historical BPS ecosystem, and the right
side shows the current EVT ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p>The acre value shows how many acres converted from that BPS type
to the EVT type.</p></li>
<li><p>There are over 2000 comparisons over 152 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>The acreages were calculated based on the quantity of
900m<sup>2</sup> pixels (30m x 30m), which was converted to
acres.</p></li>
<li><p>You can sort columns by ascending or descending order, as well as
filter results or search for something specific.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, 429,625 acres of North-Central Oak Barrens are now
Eastern Cool Temperate Row Crop. Well, roughly.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a perfect comparison and is only intended on
giving you a general idea of what’s going on.</p>
