TO DO ON DA DASH:

<!-- 1. remove area of interest tab -->
<!--     * make index (Welcome!) page formatted with a column -->
<!--     * put text from AoI tab on Welcome tab -->
<!--     * put map on AoI on to welcome tab -->
2. Actually...how about combining Welcome, Area of Interest AND Looking Back tabs?
3. Make all charts and maps accessible
    * change colors
    * larger fonts
4. Consider not using Plotly, or:
    * BpS/EVT chart
        * remove vertical axis label
        * change pop-ups 
        * change legend title to "Broad vegetation types"
        * commas on horizontal axis numbers
5. Consider scrolling pages with map and chart together OR with GGPLOT you could insert map into chart (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9917049/inserting-an-image-to-ggplot2)

RELOOK AFTER ALL OF THIS

6. edit all text once architecture is solidified
